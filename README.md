This paper aims to differentiate some words and / or phonemes acquired during imagined speech (their imagined thinking / utterance) from electroencephalographic signals. In order to achieve the proposed objective, the following objectives are pursued:

1. Establishment of the database: in this stage the aim is to acquire / establish the database to be used and segment it into signals obtained only during the imagined speech;
2. Data preprocessing to eliminate noise;
3. Characteristic extraction: in this stage the aim is to extract the information from the signal able to characterize the different statements;
4. Classification: the extracted features will be introduced into a neural network in order to differentiate the desired classes;
5. System performance: in this stage the determination of the system performance on the test set will be followed;
